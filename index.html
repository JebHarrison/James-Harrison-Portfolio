    <h2>My Background Around Software Development</h2>

    <p>

        My interest in the language of technology and software development has underpinned my daily life and fed my future aspirations. I began coding as a hobby by developing games for Unity and made the decision to turn my passion for coding into a career. 
    I have been accepted by Nology onto their software development job ready course where I am learning: front-end essentials for programming; HTML; JavaScript frameworks (react); OOP; Agile and Test; architecture and understanding computer systems; Node JS; covering typescript and angular. 
    In addition to building my coding skillset, I am taking active steps to present myself as a developer to companies.
